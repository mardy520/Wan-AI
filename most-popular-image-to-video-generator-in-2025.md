## FAQ

### What is an image to video generator?

An image to video generator is an AI-powered tool that transforms static images into dynamic videos by adding motion, effects, and sometimes audio. These tools use advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze images and create natural-looking movement, allowing users to bring still pictures to life without manual animation skills.

### How do image to video generators work?

Image to video generators use deep learning models trained on vast datasets of videos and images. When you upload an image, the AI analyzes its content, identifies objects and people, and applies realistic motion patterns based on its training. Advanced generators like Wan AI use specialized architectures such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Denoising Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to create smooth, coherent movement.

### Are image to video generators free to use?

Most image to video generators offer free tiers or trials with certain limitations. Wan AI provides a lightweight model accessible on consumer hardware, Vidu AI offers unlimited free generation in Non-Peak Mode, and Hailuo AI is currently free without registration. However, premium features like higher resolution, longer videos, watermark removal, and advanced effects typically require paid subscriptions.

### What's the difference between text-to-video and image-to-video generation?

Text-to-video generation creates videos based solely on written descriptions, giving the AI complete freedom to interpret and visualize the content. Image-to-video generation uses an existing image as the starting point, animating it while preserving its visual elements. Image-to-video typically provides more control over the final appearance since it starts with your specific visual, while text-to-video offers more creative interpretation.

### How long can videos be from image to video generators?

Video length varies by platform: Wan AI can generate videos of approximately one minute, Kling AI supports videos up to 3 minutes long, Hailuo AI creates 6-second clips, Vidu AI produces videos up to 8 seconds, and Pixverse AI generates 4-8 second videos. Longer videos generally require more processing power and may incur higher costs on premium plans.

### What resolution can I expect from image to video generators?

Resolution capabilities vary across platforms. Wan AI, Kling AI, and Vidu AI support up to 1080p resolution, while Pixverse AI offers up to 540p. Higher resolutions generally produce more detailed and professional-looking videos but may require more processing time or premium subscriptions.

### Can I use AI-generated videos for commercial purposes?

Yes, most image to video generators allow commercial use of the content they create. Wan AI, Kling AI, Vidu AI, and Pixverse AI explicitly permit commercial applications of their generated videos. However, it's always recommended to check each platform's terms of service for specific limitations or requirements, especially for large-scale commercial projects.

### How can I improve the quality of AI-generated videos?

To improve video quality, use high-resolution source images, provide detailed prompts (for platforms that accept text guidance), utilize multi-reference features when available, and select appropriate settings for your intended use. Premium features like Vidu AI's Quality mode or Wan AI's 14B parameter model can also significantly enhance results. Additionally, some platforms allow frame control to ensure smooth transitions at the beginning and end of videos.
